TASKER

This artifact was created for the JAYE Malta Start Up Programme 2019/2020

Before making use of the artifact a server has to be set up. This server has to contain the following:
    • taskerdb has to be imported.
    • the server has to have python3 installed along with geopy, the latter can be easily done by using the command : "pip install geopy"
    • all of the ProductPage folder has to be put inside of the server.
N.B: The html pages were left in the ProductPage to highlight the front-end development process of Tasker

One can make use of the website by entering home.php
All of the code for the recommender system can be found in ProductPage/rSystem.py
